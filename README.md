# Insurance Cost Prediction

## What is this project?
This is a simple Linear Regression model that tries to predict the insurance cost for a given person given some information like sex, age, children, whether or not they smoke, etc.

## What technologies were used?
The project is made with Python, utilizing libraries like
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## What did I learn?
I actually learned the most about feature selection in this project. So far in my other ML projects I didn't quite get to experience the effect of good feature selection as clearly as with this project!
